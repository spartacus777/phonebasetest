When doing first Task, i developed 2-way sorting.
While working on second task, i figured out, that my algo is pretty heavy, so i decided to search for dictionary words dynamically, while shoing them to user - see the code in ContactAdapter.
And it really works fast, and UI is pretty connected together.
Of course I can do it slightly different way, to satisfy second task from Task 2 about ordering, but for this I will have to load and calculate dictionary at once, and while this will be doing,
user would be presented with a spinner, for some big amount of time (~1 min). For real app it is not the way app should work, so I implemented it in dynamic calculation of dictionary.

Time of evaluating - task 1  ~2.5 hours
Task 2 ~ 2 hours

Sorry, can not work on task 3, since must work on my current work project.

Hope you would like what I have done, and would be glad to hear comments on task!
Thanks
